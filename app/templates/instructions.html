           <h4>Most road traffic accidents happen when a driver fails to detect a critical event, like another car turning into their path. This is due to a neurological limitation common to all people: we have a finite amount of perceptual processing power, meaning that in a complicated scene we are able to process only a fraction of the available information.
                <br><br>
                The aim of this study is to discover what makes some driving situations more demanding than others, in other words: what about a situation makes detecting critical events more difficult?</h4>

           </div>
		   <h4>You'll be presented with two short video clips (~2 sec long) of city driving taken from a driver's point-of-view. Watch both videos, putting yourself in the mindset of the driver and assume that it is a route you know and have driven many times. As you are viewing the scene, decide which situation you'd find <i>more demanding</i> on your attention to maintain safe driving. After watching the videos, select Video 1 or Video 2, by clicking the button below that video. After you've selected a video, a new pair of videos will be presented for you to watch and compare.
           <br><br>
           To get a feel for the task, do some example comparisons by pressing the button below. You can only select the more demanding video once you've watched both videos on the page. Once you feel comfortable with the task, continue onto the proper experiment. </h4>
